# accessible-play-button
A one-pager with an accessible play button for my coworkers to learn from.

I work with a lot of designers, and they don't like using the native HTML video controls across different browsers.

We have a lot of clients who want video incorporated into their homepage heroes, but as a studio we are committed to creating accessible web projects.

This is a small site I created for my coworkers to learn about how native HTML video controls work, what options we have to manipulate them, and how we can design a great, simple set of accessible controls.
