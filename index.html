    <h1>This is an accesible play-pause button. It is an alternative to HTML's native video controls.</h1>

    <h2>Why did you build that?</h2>
    <p>Multimedia elements such as images, audio tracks, and videos aren't as easily understood by screenreaders or navigated by the keyboard as text, and we need to give them a helping hand. All elements on a site need to be given proper textual alternatives so they can be understood by assistive technologies and their users.</p>
    
    <h2>Doesn't HTML already have a &ltvideo&gt tag that includes controls?</h2>
    <p>HTML5 video and audio instances even come with a set of inbuilt controls that allow you to control the media straight out of the box. </p>
    <p>However, there are problems with these controls:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        They are not keyboard-accessible in most browsers, i.e. you can't tab between the controls inside the native player. Chrome is actually pretty good, but Safari does not let you tab through controls.
      </li>
      <li>
        Different browsers give the native controls differing styling and functionality, and they aren't stylable, meaning that they can't be easily made to follow a site style guide.
      </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>How do you build an accesible one?</h2>

    <details>
      <summary><b>Step 1:</b> Create new, basic video control elements in your HTML.</summary>
      <p>I added a &ltsection&gt element that includes a &ltvideo&gt element with my mp4 file, as well as a new &ltdiv&gt element that includes my new video controls.</p>

    </details>

    <details>
      <summary><b>Step 2:</b> Use JavaScript to add functionality to the controls you created.</summary>
      <p>In a script.js file, create a variable for your video player so that we can manipulate it. I also disabled the native controls of the video so that I can add my own funcitonality.</p>

    </details>

    <details>
      <summary><b>Step 3:</b> Write a JS function to control the play/pause button</summary>
      <p>Use conditional logic to toggle between play and pause buttons. </p>
      <p>This function controls the player itself and also toggles a CSS class that styles the button with a play or pause icon.</p>

    </details>

    <details>
      <summary><b>Step 4:</b>If appropriate, add other video controls such as rewind, fast-forward and stop.</summary>
      <p>Check the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement">HTMLMediaElement</a> properties for other ways to access and code functionality into your video player.</p>
      <p>For example, you can use player.currentTime to code rewind or fast-forward.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary><b>Step 5:</b> Check your control for color-contrast and keyboard accessibility.</summary>
      <p>Ensure that beyond including text alternatives, your controls are visible and easy to control with the keyboard.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary><b>Step 6:</b> Consider other accessibility tools, such as video transcripts and closed captioning.</summary>
      <p>You can provide an audio transcript of video content, or add closed captioning for dialogue, along with audio descriptions of what is happening in the video.</p>
